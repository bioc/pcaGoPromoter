Title: pcaGoPromoter is used to analyze DNA micro array data
Author: Morten Hansen, Jorgen Olsen
Maintainer: Morten Hansen <mhansen@sund.ku.dk>
Description: This package contains functions to ease the analyses of DNA micro
  arrays. It utilizes principal component analysis as the initial multivariate
  analysis, followed by functional interpretation of the principal component
  dimensions with overrepresentation analysis for GO terms and regulatory
  interpretations using overrepresentation analysis of predicted transcription
  factor binding sites with the primo algorithm.
